#Background
The Norwegian Polar Institute Expedition Database is a tool for keeping track of NPI’s expeditions in the long run. The database will be used for presenting our expeditions to the outside world, and for reporting to our owners, Office of the Auditor General in Norway (Riksrevisjonen) and others asking about our activities.

The field- or cruise leader is responsible for completing the field for his/hers activities. According to SeaDataNet, the expedition report should be submitted to the National Oceanographic Data Centre (NODC, here Institute of Marine Research) no later than two weeks after the cruise. All fields in the database should be completed as long as they are relevant to the activity. When the entry is published all entered information will be available to the outside world, except personal information (individual persons and time periods).


#Login
To enter a new entry in the database or to edit a draft entry, start by logging in to
[Norwegian Polar Institute Expedition Database](https://data.npolar.no/expedition). Use the "user menu" button located in the upper right corner (se picture below).

[[https://github.com/npolar/npdc-expedition/blob/master/docs/img/800px-Expedition_login_small.png | alt="How to login"]]

If you do not have a data.npolar.no account, choose the "user menu" icon, write your e-mail address and choose the "email code"-button. You should then receive a one-time password and a link to update your password by email. If you know your login name but have forgotten your password, you can also use the button "email code".

If you do not see any green buttons to the right at all when you should be logged in, you are either not logged in or something is wrong. By hovering over the "user menu" button, you should see your login name as a check. If you only see "User menu", try to log in again. If you still do not succeed, [contact us](https://github.com/npolar/npdc-expedition/wiki/helpfile#contact).

#Get started
Go to the homepage, [Norwegian Polar Institute Expedition Database](https://data.npolar.no/expedition). To enter a new entry, choose "New", the green "+"-icon button in the top right corner (see screenshot below).

[[https://github.com/npolar/npdc-expedition/blob/master/docs/img/800px-Expedition_new_small.png |alt="Use new button"]]

To edit an existing record not yet submitted, select the entry and open the listing for this entry. Choose "Edit”, the green button in the right corner with a pencil-icon. When you are on the edit page, you can save your data by using the green "Save" button to the right with a disk symbol.

[[https://github.com/npolar/npdc-expedition/blob/master/docs/img/800px-Save_add_expend_small.png |alt="Use save button"]]

You can add a new entry by clicking on the blue "+"-symbol or expand an already created entry by clicking on the "v" symbol. Similarly, you can delete an entry or move it down in the list by using the "three lines"-symbol (see picture above).

You can switch between tabs as you wish without saving, but you should save from time to time not to loose data. After you have saved the information, the first tab page will appear again.

On the last tab, "Edits", when you set "draft (not visible to Internet users)" to "no" and save, the entry will be visible to Internet users. If set to "yes" the entry will not be visible to Internet users.
